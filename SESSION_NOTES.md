# Development Session Notes - Jan 26, 2026

## Status Checkpoint
We have successfully completed the core "MVP" visual polish and marketing foundation.
- **Landing Page**: Highly interactive "Rank Anything" landing page with dynamic typewriter animation and persona-targeted copy (Alex/Karen).
- **Auth Styling**: Login and Register pages now match the premium dark aesthetic.
- **Header**: Unified global header component across all pages.
- **Git**: All changes saved to main branch.

### Recent Accomplishments
*   **Refined Landing Page**: Implemented "Typewriter" effect, delayed form reveal, and drag-and-drop preview. Updated copy to address specific persona pain points (fragmentation, manual entry).
*   **Visual Consistency**: The entire flow from Landing -> Register -> Dashboard -> New Item is now visually cohesive (Dark mode, gradients, glassmorphism).

### Next Steps (To-Do)
1.  **Smart List Integration**: Connect the "Smart & Instant" landing page promise to actual backend logic (integration with external APIs for auto-filling).
2.  **Social Features**: Implement the "Share & Debate" functionality (public list views, sharing links).

## How to Resume
1.  Open this directory in Antigravity or your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/philreed/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/list-app
    ```
2.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  Open `http://localhost:3000` (or `3001` if prompted).

Your code is fully version controlled in the local `git` repository.
